The packaging materials\nused are selected from materials which\nare environmentally friendly for disposal\nand should be recycled.\n\nRecycling the packaging reduces the\nuse of raw materials in the manufactur‐\ning process and also reduces the\namount of waste in landfill sites.\n##### **Disposal of your old appliance**\n\nElectrical and electronic appliances of‐\nten contain valuable materials. They al‐\nso contain materials which, if handled\nor disposed of incorrectly, could be po‐\ntentially hazardous to human health and\nto the environment. They are, however,\nessential for the correct functioning of\nyour appliance. Please do not therefore\ndispose of it with your household\nwaste.\n\nPlease dispose of it at your local com‐\nmunity waste collection / recycling cen‐\ntre.\n\nEnsure that it presents no danger to\nchildren while being stored for disposal.\n\n2\n\n##### **Energy saving tips**\n\nTo avoid unnecessarily long drying\ntimes and high consumption of energy:\n\n– Make sure that your laundry is thor‐\noughly spun before drying. The high‐\ner the spin, the greater the savings\nthat can be made in energy and time\nduring drying.\n\n– Load according to the optimum\namount of laundry recommended for\nthe programme being used. Under‐\nloading is uneconomical. Overload‐\ning gives a poorer quality of drying\nand may cause unnecessary creas‐\ning.\n\n– Make sure the room temperature is\nnot too high. If there are other heat\nproducing appliances in the room in\nwhich the dryer is located, make sure\nthe room is well ventilated and switch\nthe other appliances off, if possible.\n\n– Clean the fluff filters in the door\nopening after every drying cycle.\n\n\n-----"}

Notes on correct laundry care**\n\n##### **Points to note regarding wash‐** **ed laundry**\n\n– When washing very heavily soiled\nitems ensure that you use sufficient\ndetergent and select a high tempera‐\nture. If in doubt, wash the items sev‐\neral times.\n\n– Do not put soaking wet items into the\ntumble dryer. Make sure your laundry\nis thoroughly spun before drying. The\nhigher the spin speed, the greater the\nsavings that can be made in energy\nand time during drying.\n\n– New dark coloured garments should\nbe washed and dried separately from\nlight coloured garments to avoid the\ndanger of colours running and disco‐\nlouring other garments or even plas‐\ntic components in the dryer. Dark\ncoloured fibres can also settle on\nlight coloured garments and vice ver‐\n\nsa.\n\n– Starched laundry can be dried in the\ntumble dryer. To achieve the usual\nfinish, double the amount of starch\nshould be used.\n##### **Preparing the laundry before** **drying**  Make sure that any objects, e.g.\n\ndetergent dosing balls, lighters etc.\nhave been removed from the laun‐\ndry.\nThey could melt or explode and\ncause damage to the dryer or the\nlaundry.\n\n#####  See \"Warning and Safety\" in‐\n\nstructions for further information.\n\nLoading or using the tumble dryer in‐\ncorrectly could cause a fire.\n\n– Sort the laundry according to the\ntype of fibre and weave, size, gar‐\nment care label symbol and the dry‐\ning level required.\n\n– Check the seams of padded or\ndown-filled items to prevent the risk\nof fillings coming out. These could\ncatch fire when being dried.\n\n– Disentangle the laundry.\n\n– Tie together textile belts and ties.\n\n– Fasten . . .\n. . . duvet covers and pillow cases to\nprevent small items from being trap‐\nped inside them.\n. . . hooks and eyes.\n\n– Sew in or remove underwiring from\nbras."}

Otherwise drying\ndurations may be longer (increased en‐\nergy requirement).\n\n**Before moving the tumble dryer**\n**again (e.g. when moving house)**\n\nAfter each use a small quantity of con‐\ndensed water will collect in the area of\nthe pump. This water can run out if the\ntumble dryer is tipped up when it is be‐\ning moved. Recommendation: run the\n*Warm air* programme for approximately\n1 minute before moving the tumble dry‐\ner. Any remaining condensed water will\nthen be fed into the condensed water\ncontainer or out through the drain hose.\n\n61\n\n\n-----"}
